# Sensor Fusion
This code runs on an STM32F411E-DISCOVERY [board reference
MB1115D](https://www.st.com/resource/en/data_brief/32f411ediscovery.pdf). We
implmement [ST's APIs](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Standard_C_drivers) to
communicate with the I3G4250D (gyroscope), LSM303AGR (accelerometer,
magnetometer), and LIS3MDL (magnetometer). 

## Directory structure
```
Core/
	Inc/ - header files
		main.h
		badsched.h - bad scheduler
		debug.h - printf statements to help debugging
		[gpio.h, i2c.h, spi.h,
		stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h,
		stm32f4xx_it.h, tim.h] - I/O and interrupts, generated by Cube
		sensors/ - headers for the sensors we're using
			
	Src/ - source files
		main.c - main script, partially generated by Cube
			Initalizes everything and starts the main loop
		badsched.c - bad scheduler code
		debug.c - printf statements to help debugging
		[gpio.c, i2c.c, spi.c,
		stm32f4xx_hal_conf.c,
		stm32f4xx_it.c, tim.c] - I/O and interrupts, generated by Cube
		sensors/ - HAL implementations of ST's APIs 
	Startup/ - generated by Cube
Drivers/ - generated by Cube, provides the HAL for the STM32F4 series
