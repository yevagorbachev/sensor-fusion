# Sensor Fusion
This code runs on an STM32F411E-DISCOVERY [board reference
MB1115D](https://www.st.com/resource/en/data_brief/32f411ediscovery.pdf). We
implmement [ST's APIs](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Standard_C_drivers) to
communicate with the I3G4250D (gyroscope), LSM303AGR (accelerometer,
magnetometer), and LIS3MDL (magnetometer).
